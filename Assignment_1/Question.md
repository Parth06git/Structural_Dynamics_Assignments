# Given Information

m = 10 kg \br
k = 1000 N/m
x(0) = 0.1 m
$\hat{x}$(0) = 10 m/s

# Problem

1. Plot the undamped free vibration responce of the system.
2. Plot the damped free vibration of the system considering under-damped, critical damped and over-damped conditions.

# Solution of part - 1

$x(t) = x(0)cos($w_{n}$t) + $\frac{$\hat{x}$}{$w_{n}$}$sin($w_{n}$t)$
where,

$($w_{n}$ = $$\frac{k}{m}$^{0.5}$)$
