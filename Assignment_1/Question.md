# Given Information

m = 10 kg \
k = 1000 N/m \
x(0) = 0.1 m,
$\hat{x}$(0) = 10 m/s 

# Problem

1. Plot the undamped free vibration responce of the system.
2. Plot the damped free vibration of the system considering under-damped, critical damped and over-damped conditions.

# Solution of part - 1
```math
x(t) = x(0)cos(w_nt) + (\hat{x}(0)\w_n)sin(w_nt)
```
where,

```math
w_n = \sqrt{k/m}
```
